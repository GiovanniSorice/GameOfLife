# Parallel Divide and Conquer
The purpose of this assignment was to implement a parallel version of the Divide and Conquer skeleton. I started from a given sequential implementation, the one in [this file](divideConquer.cpp).

## Challenges
A problem that I faced since the beginning was that a parallel version of the DaC algorithm needed to keep under control the degree of parallelism of the program.
In fact, being DaC an algorithm that **recurses** untill the base case is reached, letting the concurrency level under no leash would mean to create hundreds, possibly thousands, of threads.  
For this reason I added a parameter called ```cutoff``` used to switch to the sequential version of the divide & conquer algorithm from a certain point on. 
The *user* of the skeleton can then determine a good check to use as a stopping condition in the function ```checkCutoff()```.

## Example usage
To show a real usage of the algorithm I created the class [MergeSort](main.cpp). Part of the implementation of the MergeSort is based on the work of [Tiziano de Matteis](https://github.com/TizianoDeMatteis).


## Building
To generate the build system do:  
```
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
```
in the root of the cloned project.  

Now build the project:
```
cmake --build .
```


## Running
The executable can be found in the ```build/``` directory. Just run it with:

```./build/divide_conquer```
