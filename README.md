Assignment 1 and 2 of Parallel and Distributed Systems: Paradigms and Models course
The first assignment was to made a simplified and parallel version of the Game of Life. There are 4 version GoLSeq, GoLThread,GoLOMP and GoLPool in which there are respectively
the implementation of the sequential code, parallel code with c++ standard thread used as fork-join, parallel code with OpenMP and parallel code with c++ standard thread used as a pool of
worker and queue of tasks. For more info see the [report](/GoL/report/Report.pdf).
